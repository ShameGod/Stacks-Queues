# Stacks-Queues
a cheat sheet about stacks and queues

Stacks and queues are similar data structures, they are both linear. 
Queues are a FIFO : First In First Out
Stacks are a LIFO : Last In First Out

To declare a queue :

*Notice in this declaration we should add a check to see if head is null in order to avoied a NPE*

There are two limited operation with the queue data structure :
* Queuing : adding an element at **end/ tail** of the queue 
* Dequeueing : removing an element at the **front/ head** of the queue, ***only possible on the head of the queue***


To declare a stacks :

we just need a top since we add and remove from the top of the stack.

Once again the NPE are not checked in order to make this simple
